Students can choose from a variety of options, such as studios, cottages etc. The properties are stylishly designed and equipped with premium amenities, such as Wi-Fi, smart TV, boreholes, solar power etc.

However, we also recognize that there are many students who have specific preferences or needs for their off-campus accommodation, such as proximity to campus, budget, or number of roommates.

We will also consider factors such as availability and feedback from previous tenants.

- Students and owners or agents can negotiate the terms and conditions of the lease agreement without any interference from Casamax Investments. Casamax Investments does not charge any commission or fee from either party.
- Casamax Investments provides customer support and assistance to both students and owners or agents throughout the process. We also monitor the quality and safety of the houses and ensure that they comply with our standards and regulations.

What are the benefits?
